Are you looking to enhance your web development skills by transforming your project into a multi-language website using Next.js? One powerful strategy to achieve this is by integrating multi-language capabilities. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of implementing a multi-language website using next-intl within Next.js.

<H2 text="Understanding next-intl"/>

next-intl is a modern and highly efficient internationalization (i18n) framework designed for Next.js. Internationalization is crucial for enhancing user experience, and next-intl provides all the necessary tools to manage language nuances effectively.

<H2 text="Getting Started with Next.js"/>

Before we delve into integrating i18n, it's essential to have a foundational understanding of Next.js and to ensure you've set up a Next.js project on your local machine. If you haven't done so already, refer to the  <Link text="official documentation" href="https://nextjs.org/docs"/> for installation instructions.

With Next.js set up, you can now install the next-intl library by running the following commands in your project:

<Code code="npm install next-intl"/>

Next, create the following file structure:

<Code code={`
├── messages
│ ├── en.json
│ └── ...
├── next.config.mjs
└── src
    ├── i18n.ts
    ├── middleware.ts
    └── app
        └── [locale]
            ├── layout.tsx
            └── page.tsx
`}/>

Now, simply follow the <Link text="6 steps" href="https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing"/> outlined in the official next-intl documentation for app routing in Next.js. If you are using the pages router in Next.js, don't worry—next-intl supports that as well, and you can find the instructions <Link href="https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/pages-router" title="here"/>.
