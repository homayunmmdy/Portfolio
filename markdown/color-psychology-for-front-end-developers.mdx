  For front-end developers, knowing how colors affect emotions is important for
  making websites that people like and find helpful. Let’s look closer at how
  it’s important:
</Quote>

<B>Feelings:</B> When you pick colors for a website, think about how you want people
to feel when they see it. Here are some examples:

<B>Blue:</B> Makes people feel like they can trust the website and feel calm. It’s
good for things like navigation bars.


<B>Red:</B> Makes people feel excited and in a hurry. Use it for important things
like "Buy Now" buttons.


<B>Green:</B> Makes people feel safe and like things are going well. It’s used a
lot for websites about money or nature.


<B>Yellow:</B> Makes people feel happy and warm. Use it for important things or to
make the website feel friendly.


<B>Black:</B> Makes things feel fancy and serious. It’s used for expensive brands
or to make other colors stand out.


<B>White:</B> Makes things look clean and simple. Having some empty space on the
website helps people read it better. 


As a front-end developer, you will work with
designers to make sure the colors they pick look good on the website. Make sure the
colors stay the same on all the pages so it looks nice and works well. Also, think
about people who might have trouble seeing colors when you pick them.

Knowing how colors affect feelings can help you make websites that people like using and that work well for everyone.
